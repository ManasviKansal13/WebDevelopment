    <h3>The mythological story of the Golgappa could be traced to the ‘Mahabharata’. As per the tale, when a
        newly-wedded Draupadi came home, she was given a task by her mother-in-law Kunti. As the Pandavas were living in
        exile, they had to manage with scarce resources. Kunti wanted to test if her new daughter-in-law would be able
        to manage with them . So she gave Draupadi some leftover vegetables and just enough wheat dough to make one
        puri. She instructed her to make food that would satisfy the hunger of all her sons. It is believed that this
        was when the new bride invented an early variation of Golgappa. </h3>
